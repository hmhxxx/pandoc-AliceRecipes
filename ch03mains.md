> For this dish I made sure to go right to the source in Northern Thailand so your culinary skills will astound your new friends. You will certainly be the host and hostess with the mostest! Remember to adjust the chilli levels to accommodate your guests. My head chef said the more chilli you add, the sexier you are. Keep that in mind.

3. Add the remaining ingredients and pound hard until the texture is smooth

## Green curry paste  
*Dad*

For Prawn or Chicken with green curry

### Ingredients
  - 2 stalks of lemongrass
  - 4 spring onions
  - 3 fresh green chillies
  - 4 cloves of garlic
  - thumb-sized piece of fresh root ginger
  - large bunch of fresh coriander
  - 1 tsp coriander seeds
  - 8 fresh or dried lime leaves (optional)
  - 2 tblsp soy sauce
  - 1 tblsp fish sauce

### Directions
  1. Trim the lemongrass stalks, peel back and discard the outer leaves, and crush the stalks by bashing them a few times with the heel of your hand or a rolling pin.  
  Trim the spring onions. Halve and de-seed the green chillies. Peel and roughly chop the garlic and ginger.  

  Set aside a few sprigs of fresh coriander and whiz the rest in a food processor with the lemongrass stalks, spring onions, chillies, garlic, ginger, coriander seeds and lime leaves until everything is finely chopped – the smell will be amazing!  
  2. While whizzing, pour in the soy sauce and fish sauce and blitz again until you have a smooth paste. If you don’t have a food processor, chop everything by hand as finely as you can – it may take a while but it will be so worth it.

## Prawns with Green Curry  
*Dad's special dinner*

### Ingredients 
- One large bunch of asparagus or a large handful of baby corn
- ½ fresh red chilli
- 1 tbsp groundnut oil
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 180g raw king prawns, peeled
- ½ x 400ml tin of coconut milk
- Handful of mange tout (snow peas)
- 1 lime

### Directions
  1. Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and discard them or, if using, run the asparagus stalks through a runner bean slicer, or finely slice them lengthways with a knife. Finely chop the red chilli and put to one side.
  2. Place a large pan or wok over a high heat. When it’s really hot, add the groundnut and sesame oils, swirl them around, then carefully drop in the prawns. Add the asparagus or baby corn and your green curry paste and stir-fry for about 30 seconds.
  3. Pour in the coconut milk and add the mange tout. Give it all a good stir, bring to the boil and cook for a few minutes. Have a taste and add a bit more soy sauce if you think it needs it.
  4. Push down on the lime and roll it around to get the juices going, then cut it in half. Squeeze the juice into the pan – this will give your curry a lovely twang.

### To serve your curry:
  - Pick the leaves off the remaining coriander sprigs.
  - Serve the curry sprinkled with the coriander leaves and the chopped red chilli and some fluffy rice.

**Serves:** 2

### Jamie Oliver's tips  
  - Make up a big batch of paste and freeze it in portions so that you have it to hand whenever you need it.
  - This recipe only uses half a tin of coconut milk so remember to shake it before you start as it has a tendency to separate.
  - You can use this green curry paste, on its own as a delicious marinade if you’re having barbecue. Try roasting chicken thighs in the oven at 150C for an hour, then finishing them off on the barbecue so you get tender sticky meat and wicked crispy and smoky skin.

## Light and fluffy Rice

 **Serves:** 4 to 6

### Ingredients:
  - sea salt
  - 350g basmati rice

### Directions
  1. Put a large pan of salted water on a high heat and bring to the boil. Rinse the rice in a colander under running water for about 1 minute, or until the water runs clear. This will stop the grains sticking together later.
  2. Add your rice to the boiling water and wait for the grains to start dancing around. From that point, boil for 5 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander. Pour 2.5cm of water into the pan and bring it to the boil again, then turn down to a simmer. Cover the rice in the colander with foil or a lid and place on top of the pan of simmering water and let the rice steam over it for 8 to 10 minutes.
  3. Remove from the heat and, if you’re ready, serve immediately. If not, leave the foil or lid on and put aside until ready to serve – it should stay warm for about 20 minutes.

## Delhi Chole (Mother's Recipe!)  
*Struthi Baskaran (Channa recipe!) *

> So, the Delhi Chole is basically a spicy chickpea curry that is usually served with a deep-fried flat bread called "bhatura" (but regular naan would go very well with this too). Besides the raw ingredients that goes into the making of this curry, I think what is really unique is how you make the spice-mix that gives the curry its distinctive flavor. If you're strapped for time, you can get this at most ethnic / specialty grocery stores! (It's called Chole Masala) But I've written down my mother's recipe for making the spice mix as well as the actual curry.

### Spice Mix

#### Ingredients:
  - 1.25 – 1.5 tablespoons of coriander Seeds 
  - 1/3 inch Cinnamon Stick
  - 2 Cloves
  - 1 Black Cardamom or 2 Green Cardamoms 
  - 1/3 teaspoon of black peppercorn powder or ~40 black peppercorns (if you grind it yourself)
  - 1 + 1/3 teaspoon cumin seeds 
  - half bay leaf 
  - half red dry chili

#### Procedure:

Dry roast all the ingredients on medium flame until spices are dark brown in color. Let the spices cool and grind to a fine powder. This yields about 2 ½ – 3 tablespoons of the chole masala.

Alternatively, you could buy this at the store. Everest is a good brand!

### Curry

#### Ingredients:

  - 1 cup dry chickpeas or 2 cups cooked chickpeas (I usually buy the low-sodium variety because I like adding salt to taste)
  - 2 tbsp oil
  - 1/2 medium or large onion or 2/3 cups of chopped onions 
  - 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste (or half a tablespoon of each if bought separately)
  - 1/2 large tomato or 1/3 cup chopped tomatoes 
  - 2 teaspoons of salt (I grew up in a pretty low-sodium household, but you can adjust this to taste!) 
  - 3/4 tsp red chili powder
  - 2.5 –3 tablespoons of the chole masala (spice mix from above)

### Preparation:

  1. If you are using dry chickpeas, first wash and soak them overnight or at least 6 - 7 hours.
  2. After soaking, pressure cook chickpeas with 2 cups of water for 5 -6 whistles or until the chickpeas are cooked.  
I usually cook for 6 whistles in my prestige cooker, however for chole or chana masala I cook for 5 whistles as the chickpeas will be cooked again along with the spices.  
An alternative is to buy canned chickpeas that are low-sodium and are already soaked.
  3. Add a spoonful of oil in a sauce pan and fry chopped onions until light brown.
  4. Add the ginger garlic paste and fry for a minute or until raw the raw smell is gone.
  5. Add tomatoes, salt, and cook until tomatoes are soft and mushy.   Reduce the flame and fry until oil begins to separate and tomatoes and finely roasted. Keep stirring the onion tomato mixture from burning.   
Collectively, it'll take around 15 minutes to saute the tomatoes and onions. 
  6. Add green chilies (3 small ones), chili powder, chole masala, and mix properly. Continue to fry for a minute or two until green chilies are lightly roasted.
  7. Remove the chilies and keep aside for garnishing.
  8. Add cooked chickpeas and mix well. Add 2 cups of water and bring it to a boil. Adjust water to required consistency.  
I used 1 cup reserved water after cooking the chickpeas and 1 cup regular water.  
Cover and cook for about 10 minutes or until the chole is done. If using canned chickpeas, this can be reduced to around 7 minutes. 
  9. Garnish with a splash of lime juice and cilantro! 
  10. Enjoy with either deep-fried bread or naan :)

## Mushroom & Spinach Risotto  
*Alice selection*

### Ingredients
  * 1 cup dry quinoa
  * 2 cups water
  * 1 teaspoon coconut oil
  * ½ yellow onion, chopped
  * 2 garlic cloves, minced
  * 8 oz sliced mushrooms
  * 2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
  * ½ cup water
  * salt and black pepper
  * 1 cup spinach, roughly chopped

### Instructions
  1. Combine the quinoa and water in a sauce pot over high heat, bring it to a boil, then cover and reduce the temperature to low. Allow to simmer for 15 minutes, or until all of the water is absorbed.

  2. While the quinoa is cooking, melt the coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onion for 5 minutes.

## Bolognese  
*Toby and Jan*

> This is a favourite recipe of mine because you can cook up a large batch in advance and freeze in takeaway containers, and then when you're busy or arrive home late, a "proper" dinner is only 20 minutes away (the time taken to boil water and the pasta whilst you reheat in the microwave).  And the kids eat it!! The recipe itself is very flexible - adapt as you like, leave out whatever you don't have, it'll taste fine.

### Ingredients
  - oil for frying
  - 1 kg beef mince (I use a 50:50 mix of 5% ("heart smart" and 10% ("premium") fat mince)
  - *1 large carrot, peeled and grated
  - *1 large onion, chopped finely
  - *1-2 sticks celery, chopped finely
  - *4 cloves garlic, crushed
  - unfixed amount of dry chilli (I use about 1 tsp, can leave it out)
  - 1 cup cheap red wine
  - 1 tsp beef stock dissolved in a small amount of water (check for gluten - or use salt)
  - pepper
  - 2 x 400 g tins crushed tomatoes
  - 60 g  tomato paste
  - 1/4 cup fresh parsely, chopped (or whatever herbs you have, dry or fresh)
  - 4 anchovies, finely chopped (totally optional)
mushrooms chopped (how many depends on how much you like them!  I do about 3 large ones)

### Notes
  * I sometimes chop these in a blender - do whatever's quicker
  * Plus carb of your choice on which you'll put your Bolognese, veggies/salad and parmesan cheese for serving.
  * On hot days we do burritos with the same recipe.

### Directions
  1. Heat oil, brown mince in 2-3 batches on high heat.  (If you don't want to add too much oil, put some of the lower and higher fat mince in each batch) Take out of the fry pan and set aside.
  2. Add more oil, on low heat cook the onion, carrot, celery and garlic (and chilli) until soft and "golden".
  3. Add the meat back into the frypan
  4. Add red wine, heat until it has evaporated.
  5. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef stock, anchovies, pepper and herbs. Stir stir stir.  It should look nice and dark red.  If not, add more tinned tomatoes.
  6. Simmer for however long you've got (20 minutes - 3 or more hours), stirring occasionally.   Add a little water if necessary.
  7. 10-20  minutes from the end, get your water boiling for your carb and add the mushrooms to the Bolognese.

Serve with grated parmesan cheese and veggies of your choice.

**Serves:** about 10 people or perhaps 4-5 meals for 2 of you. (Just a guess, depends how hungry you are!).

## Pork Ragu  
*Jen and Ian Kilpatrick*
  
> We're so glad to be able to share such a happy time with the two of you. Alice has been an incredible friend at the GSB, and perhaps most importantly, shares Ian's love of Vegemite. We can't wait to spend more time with Michael over the coming year and to build more memories with you both!

> A filling dish for any time of the year. Taken from Bill Granger's "Easy" cookbook, with some modifications. Can be eaten over pasta, though Jen likes to eat it by itself. Possibly because making pasta is more work than not making pasta.

### Ingredients: 
  - 5 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1kg pork scotch fillet
  - 1 onion, chopped
  - 3 tablespoons roughly chopped rosemary leaves
  - 6 garlic cloves, crushed
  - 2 strips lemon peel
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 800g tin diced tomatoes
  - 250ml (1 cup) chicken stock
  - 400g dried pappardelle (can be served with gluten free pasta, or salad, or nothing at all!)
   - 100g sourdough bread, pulsed until coarse crumbs (skip to make gluten free)
  - Finely grated zest 1 lemon
  - 3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, plus extra, to serve


### Directions:
  1. Preheat the oven to 160 degrees C. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy casserole dish over medium-high heat (the port needs to be a tight fit in the dish). Season the pork well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and sear on all sides until golden brown. Remove and set aside.
  2. Add the onion to the dish and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add 2 tablespoons rosemary and 4 garlic cloves and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add the lemon peel, bay leaf, tomatoes, and stock. Add a cup or two of water to ensure the mixture stays moist. Return the pork to the dish, bring to a simmer and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2 1/2 - 3 hours or until the pork is meltingly tender. Remove from the dish and when cool enough to handle, shred into small pieces, discarding any fat. Return the meat to the dish, season, and reheat.
  3. Cook the pappardelle in a large saucepan of salted water for 2 minutes less than the instructions on the packet, or al dente.
  4. Place a large frying pan over medium heat, add the remaining olive oil and garlic, breadcrumbs, and lemon zest and cook, tossing regularly, until golden. Let cool slightly, then add the remaining rosemary and 3 tablespoons parsley and season well.
  5. Gently toss the ragu with the pappardelle. Sprinkle with the pangrattato and extra parsley.

**Serves:** 4

## Lakeshore Pork  
*Aisling*

*A gluten-friendly alternative to Beef and Guinness Stew, meet Pork with Mustard and Apple. It’s really easy, only needs one pot, great for a crowd at a party, and I’m sure could be attempted with cider instead of apple juice for a kick!*

*6-8 serving*

### Ingredients
  - 1.3kg/3lb pork steak or diced leg of pork, well trimmed
  - Seasoned flour (gluten free): a bit of flour, salt, pepper, mustard powder and brown sugar
  - Olive oil
  - 600ml/1 pint apple juice
  - 300ml/1/2 pint chicken stock
  - 2 tablespoons wholegrain mustard
  - 300ml/1/2 pint double cream (optional)

### Directions:
  1. Toss the pork in the seasoned flour – I think the easiest way is in a ziplock bag
  2. Brown the pork in batches in a ovenproof casserole that also goes on the hob
  3. Return all the meat to the casserole dish, cover with the apple juice and stock and add the mustard.
  4. Bring to the boil
  5. Transfer to the oven, preheated to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4, for 40-50 minutes
  6. If using cream, remove from the oven, stir in the cream, and return to the oven for 10 minutes (it’s delicious either way, but the cream makes it that bit richer)
  7. Goes well with rice, mashed potatoes, or realistically, whatever carb you want
