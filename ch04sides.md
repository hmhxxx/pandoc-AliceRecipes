## Flatbread  
*Angela and Simon*  
*The simple things in life are often the best.*  
*Fast, simple and delicious when hot. Thanks Jamie Oliver.*

### Ingredient lists 

#### for the flatbreads:
- 350g	self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
- sea salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 350g natural yoghurt

#### for the garlic and herb butter (optional):
- 2 cloves of garlic
- a bunch of fresh soft herbs, such as flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, basil, dill
- 40g unsalted butter

### Directions:
1. Add all the flatbread ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix together with a spoon, then use clean hands to pat and bring everything together. 

2. Dust a clean work surface with flour, then tip out the dough.

3. Knead for a minute or so to bring it all together (this isn't a traditional bread recipe, so you don't need to knead it for long -- just enough time to bring everything together). 

4. Put the dough into a floured-dusted bowl and cover with a plate, then leave aside.


5. If making the garlic butter: peel the garlic cloves and crush them with a garlic crusher. 

6. Pick the herb leaves onto a chopping board and finely chop them, discarding the stalks. 

7. Melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat, then stir through the garlic and chopped herbs, then set aside.

8. Dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour, then divide the dough in half, then divide each half into 6 equal-sized pieces (roughly the size of a golf ball). 

9. With your hands, pat and flatten the dough, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece into 12cm rounds, roughly 2mm to 3mm thick. 

10. Use a knife to cut 6 lines into the centre of each round, leaving about 3cm at each end.

11. Place the bbq on a high heat, then once hot, cook each one for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until bar-marked and puffed up, turning with tongs. 

12. Brush the flatbreads all over with herby garlic butter as they come off the bbq, then pile onto a serving board so everyone can dig in and help themselves.
