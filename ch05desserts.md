*A Gluten/Dairy free sponge cake recipe that's yummy!  :)*  
*Enjoy! (Particularly tasty with some Cool Whip and raspberries and strawberries!)*


### Ingredients

-  7 eggs
-  1 1/2 cups sugar, sifted
-  1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon rind
-  1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
-  3/4 cup potato starch sifted
-  dash of salt
-  350 degree oven

### Directions
1.  Separate six of the eggs.  Beat the six yolks and one whole egg until frothy.  Gradually add sifter sugar, lemon juice and lemon rind, beating constantly and thoroughly.  Then gradually add the sifted potato starch stirring constantly to ensure through blending.
2.  Beat egg whites with the salt until stiff but not dry.  Fold gently but thoroughly into egg yolk mixture.
3.  Place in ungreased 10 inch tube pan.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) about 55 minutes or until cake springs back when touched gently with fingers.  Invert pan and cool thoroughly before removing cake.

### Notes:  
- potato starch and potato flour are interchangeable.  
- Make sure your pan is ungreased or the cake will not rise.  I usually invert cake over a bottle until it cools. 
- This is the original recipe, it's a kosher recipe but I usually add 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the beaten egg whites.

## Ginger & Date Muffins  
*Peter and Cathy*

### Ingredients
-  2 cups of SR flour 
-  1/4 cup of caster sugar 
-  1 teaspoon mixed spice
-  1 egg
-  ½ cup chopped dates
-  125 g chopped ginger 
-  2/3 cup chopped walnuts
-  1 cup milk
-  1/3 cup vegetable oil

Makes 12 muffins

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 200 C.
2.  Lightly grease tins.
3.  Sift the flour then mix in sugar, spice, ginger, dates and walnuts.
4.  Mix the egg, milk and oil in a separate bowl.
5.  Add the egg mix to the flour mix and combine gently.

### Notes

It is a great idea to have a jar with the chopped dates, ginger, walnuts, spice and caster sugar in the pantry ready so that with the addition of egg, flour and oil you will have the muffins in the oven only minutes after the unexpected afternoon tea guests arrive. The muffins will be ready almost as soon as the water for the coffee and tea is boiled.

*Peter and Cathy*

-  ¼ cup lime juice
-  1 ½ cup sugar
-  2 to 3 dessert spoons of Ginger syrup

For 4

### Method
1. Place ginger, water, sugar and lime juice in large sauce pan. Stir till sugar dissolves and mix boils, simmer for 3 – 5 minutes.
2. Add fruit and cook covered till fruit is softer (5 minutes depending on ripeness)

## Ginger Syrup  
*Peter and Cathy*      

*One can buy ginger syrup but here is the way to make your own.*

### Ingredients
- 1 knob of fresh ginger (30mm x 10mm dia) peeled and cut into match sticks
-  1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water

### Method:
1. Add all ingredients in small sauce pan add heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Decant to a small jar and keep in the fridge.

### Notes
  - Yellow nectarines are better than white because they make the cooking juice a lovely colour.
  - Peaches are also very good and if late in the season use non “cling stones” as they are more lady like for your guests to eat.
  - As to the amount of poaching water, cover the bottom of a large saucepan with nectarines (cook more than you need as they are great for breakfast
  - Add water till it comes 2/3 of the way up the nectarines then remove the nectarines and add the sugar, lime juice and ginger syrup. 
  - If you end up with too much poaching liquid then remove the fruit, add heat and reduce the liguid so concentrating the colour, sweetness and flavour.
  - The ginger syrup lasts for ages in the fridge.


## Blueberry banana pancakes  
*Alice request*

**Serves:**  makes 6-8 small pancakes (serves 2)

### Ingredients
  - 1 ripe medium banana
  - ⅔ cup Almond Milk, more if needed
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla
  - ¾ cup flour (I used half GF flour, half millet flour)
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder (make sure it's fresh)
  - ½ teaspoon cinnamon
  - ⅛ teaspoon salt
  - ¼ cup blueberries, plus more for topping
  - a few teaspoons coconut oil, for the pan
  - maple syrup, for serving

**blueberry topping:**

  - ¼ cup blueberries + a drizzle of maple syrup + tiny pinch of salt

### Instructions

  1. In a small food processor, puree the banana with the almond milk and
    vanilla. (or mash it really well by hand - you want it pretty
    liquified).
  2. In a separate medium sized bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.
    Pour the banana/milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until
    just combined. (If your batter is too thick, stir in a little more
    almond milk). Gently stir in the blueberries.
  3. Heat a few teaspoons of coconut oil in a large skillet over medium
    heat. Using a ¼ cup measuring cup, scoop the pancake batter into the
    pan. Flip when bubbles form in the batter (about 1 minute). Let the
    second side cook for about 30-60 seconds and remove from heat.
    (check the first one to make sure it's done in the middle, if not,
    you may need to reduce heat to low and let it cook a little bit
    longer).
  4. For the blueberry topping, place blueberries in a small bowl with a
    little bit of maple syrup. Microwave for 20-30 seconds or until they
    burst a little.
  5. Serve pancakes warm with blueberry sauce and maple syrup.

## Notes

You could use vanilla Almond Breeze and cut back a little on the vanilla
extract.

A note about flours: gluten free flour is more dense, so I use less of
it than regular flour. I've been using a combo of bob's red mill gluten
free all purpose, and millet flour. Gluten free oat flour would also
work here.

## Quince Tart Tartin  
*Tricia*

### Ingredients
  - 5-8 large non-furry quinces cut late in season from Victoria
  - 2 cups sugar
  - 2-3 cups water
  - 1 loaf of thick-sliced bread
  - 250g butter, melted
  - served with 600ml thickened cream; reserved syrup from cooked quinces

### Directions
  1. Bring sugar and water to boil in pot large enough to hold quinces. Peel quinces and cut in quarter. [Tricia note:] Do not skin (put in muslim and boild fruit). Do not remove cores as pectin from the seeds gives a thicker syrup.
  2. Bring quinces to boil, cover and simmer for 1+ hours. Transfer quinces and syrup to a bowl and allow to cool. Liberally butter a deep 28cm cake tin. Carefully lift fruit from syrup, remove cores and cut each piece of quince in three slices. Arrange slices in tin, starting around edge and working to centre. There should be enough fruit to make two layers. Pour over 1 cup syrup and reserve remaining syrup.
  3. Cut crusts from 7 slices of bread. Dip each slice in melted butter and arrange on top of quince. Repeat continue cooking for further half-hour until bread is brown and crisp.
  4. Turn tart on to large platter and pour over 1 cup hot syrup. To serve, cut in slices as with cake and serve with slightly whipped thickened cream.

**Serves:** 5-8


## Rose and Raspberry Meringue Roulade  
*Bec*  
*May this dish bring you joy every time you eat it, with all my love.*

*This light, pretty and surprisingly easy dish is perfect for a summer afternoon. It would go very well with Michael and Alice’s signature cocktail, the Mazalia.* 

Serves about eight people.

### Ingredients:

#### For the meringue:
  - 4 egg whites (120g)
  - 250g caster sugar
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
  - 1 teaspoon corn flour

#### For the cream filling:
  - 100g mascarpone
  - 1 tablespoon icing sugar (plus extra for dusting)
  - 1 and a half tablespoons rose water
  - 400 ml whipping cream

#### Extra fillings and toppings:
  - 150g fresh raspberries
  - 2 tablespoons dried rose petals (available at most cooking stores or middle eastern grocers)
  - 1 tablespoon of crushed pistachios

### Directions:

  1. Preheat the oven to 160 degrees Celsius, line the base and sides of a 33 x 24cm Swiss roll tin with greaseproof paper to about 1cm above the sides (a standard baking tray with high sides will also be fine).
  2. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites with an electric mixer until they just start to firm up. Add caster sugar by the spoonful while continuing to whisk. Continue whisking until you have a firm, glossy meringue. Using a metal spoon or spatula, gently fold in the vanilla essence, cornflour and white wine vinegar (the cornflour and vinegar will keep the meringue soft so that you can make it into a roulade). Spread the mixture into the lined tin, taking care to make it as level as possible.
  3. Bake the meringue mixture in the oven for 30 minutes, until it forms a crust and is cooked through. Do not panic if bits of the meringue rise – they will level out as the meringue cools. Remove the meringue from the oven and allow to cool for about 30 minutes – it should be soft to the touch. Once the meringue is cool, carefully tip it onto a second piece of baking paper, so that the paper that was in the oven is face up. Carefully peel off the top piece of baking paper. 
  4. While the meringue is cooling, place the mascarpone, icing sugar and rose water in a large mixing bowl and hand whisk until it becomes smooth. Add the whipping cream and hand whisk for about four minutes, until it just holds its shape (you may use an electric mixer if you want, but it is very easy to over-mix so keep a close eye on it). Spread about two thirds of the cream filling over the meringue, leaving a small border around the edge. Scatter most of the raspberries and rose petals over the cream filling.
  5. Use the bottom piece of baking paper to assist you in rolling the meringue along its long edge, into a perfect log shape. Do not worry if the outside of the meringue cracks a little – this gives it a log-like texture, and will mostly be covered by the cream anyway. Carefully transfer the log onto a serving dish and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
  6. Shortly before serving, cover the top of the log with the remaining cream. Dust the log with icing sugar and scatter the remaining rose petals, raspberries and the crushed pistachios along the top. The meringue will be very soft, so cut carefully – the longer it is out of the refrigerator the easier it will be to cut.

## Pavlova  
*Kat Finch*

*This is one of the first recipes I learnt to make - don't believe the fuss that pavlova is difficult. You can't go wrong with this simple taste of home. Don't forget to claim this as our national dish. The New Zealanders had nothing to do with it.*

Serves 1-4 people depending on how hungry you are...

Allow a Sunday to make this so you have time to let the base cool and can decorate with love.

### Ingredients
  - 4 egg whites *don't let any yolk get in or it won't work.  
For best results use cold eggs.
  - 1 cup castor sugar
  - 300ml thickened cream
  - seasonal berries and fruits to serve

### Preparation
  1. Pre-heat oven to 100 degrees Celsius
  2. Use a dry bowl and dry beaters for best results and beat egg whites on high until soft peaks form
  3. Slowly, slowly add castor sugar a tablespoon at a time 
  4. when all the sugar is blended in and the meringue sticks to the bowl if you hold it above your head upside down you are ready to bake.
  5. scoop mixture onto a tray covered in baking paper *this will help you keep it together. You can use a fork to make pretty peaks or if you're short of time - leave it and you can flip the meringue upside down for serving on a flat surface and make peaks with the cream
  6. Bake for an hour checking it at 40 mins to ensure it isn't browning. When it is dry to touch it is ready.
  7. turn the oven off and leave the door ajar so your meringue can cool slowly in the oven
  8. clean the beaters and beat your thickened cream. (if you are finding the cream hard to mix you can add some icing sugar and vanilla essence for fun). Add cream to cool base
  9. decorate and consume large portions.
