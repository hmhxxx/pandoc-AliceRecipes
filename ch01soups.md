## Potato and Fennel Soup  
*Aisling*  
*Delighted to provide some student dishes with a twist, so you can look back fondly on your California days!*

*Living up to some stereotypes, I believe you can never have too many ways to eat potatoes! This lasts really well in the freezer, and cheered up many a post McKinsey late night.*

3-4 servings

### Ingredients

- 1 onion, peeled and diced

- 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced

- 15g/1/2 oz butter (or 1tbsp olive oil)

- 4 fennel bulbs, thinly sliced

- 1.2l/2 pints vegetable stock

- 300ml/1/2 pint milk (optional)

### Directions:

1. Sweat the onions and potatoes in the butter or oil over a very low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

2. Add the fennel, stock and some salt and pepper and bring to the boil

3. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 20 minutes

4. Puree in a blender or with a stick blender

5. Stir in the milk if desired - if you’re not adding milk, add more water if you find the soup too thick.

6. Reheat gently and season to serve



## Spicy baked potato soup  
*Rui*  
*one of my favorite hearty winter meals!*
 
### Ingredients:
- 1 lb bulk hot italian sausage
- 2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 tb minced garlic
- 2 liters chicken stock
- 6 large potatoes, thinly sliced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Lots of kale
 
### Directions:
1. in a large pot or dutch oven, cook the italian sausage and red pepper flakes until crumbly and brown; set aside, but leave the drippings in the pot
2. Cook the onions and garlic until soft and translucent - use medium heat so they don't brown, but they should be very soft
3. Pour in the chicken broth and the sausage from earlier and bring to a boil
4. Add in the potatoes and cook on medium heat until potatoes are tender
5. Add in the cream, and simmer for ~5 minutes
6. Just before serving, add in the kale. The kale in this soup should always be fresh - so if you plan on having leftovers, make sure there is no kale in there - the kale can be added raw upon heating back up!
